##### A funny story

A couple of years ago i came back from a party with a couple of friends;
The designated driver drove the tiniest fiat available and we were 10 people.
How to fit 10 people in a car that takes 5?
Here is a handy guide:
1. You stack 2 on  the passenger seat
2. You stack 6 on the back seat
3. Put one in the trunck with the beer
4. The driver takes his seat

Obviously I was the poor soul that went into the trunk.
By the time i got out i was hammered because, while curled up my keys poked holes into some of the beer cans and didnt want that to go to waste so i just tried to drink as much of it as possible.
