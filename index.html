<h4>A funny story</h4>
<br>
<p>
    A couple of years ago i came back from a party with a couple of friends.<br>
    The designated driver drove the tiniest fiat available and we were 10 people.<br>
    How to fit 10 people in a car that takes 5?<br>
    Here is a handy guide:
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>You stack 2 on  the passenger seat</li>
        <li>You stack 6 on the back seat</li>
        <li>Put one in the trunck with the beer</li>
        <li>The driver takes his seat</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    Obviously I was the poor soul that went into the trunk.<br>
    By the time i got out i was hammered because, while curled up my keys poked holes into some of the beer cans.<br>
    I didnt want that to go to waste so i just tried to drink as much of it as possible.<br>


<strong>TL;DR I Once gut drunk in the trunk of a car</strong>
